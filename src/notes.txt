Potential roles  for a 4 person team:

Manager: can work on all parts, in charge of overseeing progress on all parts, researching new methods, debugging support, runs daily standups, plans sequencing

Designer: styling, mainly collab w/ front end on jsx 

Front end dev: all components, routes, etc. collabs w/ backend on mongo and API connections

Backend dev: CRUD routes, schema, APIs, mongo, collabs w/ front end dev. 


Workflow

First steps:
Set up and deploy a blank react app
designer works on static rendering
backend sets up schema, api access, mongo
front end sets up components, etc w/ dummy data


Next steps: 
front and back end collaborate on any CRUD routes/ functions for one page at a time i.e. index first, then show, etc. 
Front end and designer start to merge static styled sheets w/ front end jsx content, one page at a time.

Post-MVP:
Revisit first steps for any additional stretch features, repeat process

Final steps: 
Testing, edge cases, final debugs, polishing
